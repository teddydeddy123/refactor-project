# SnackBar Refactor Exercise

This repository contains a simplified SnackBar component that has grown organically over time.

Your task is to **refactor the code for readability, maintainability, and scalability**.  
This is a refactor-only exercise — you do **not** need to run the code or produce any output.


## Setup
Please run **yarn install** to fix potential linting errors in Snackbar.tsx


## Goals

- Improve code clarity and structure

There is no single “correct” solution.


## Constraints

- **Do not modify `SnackBar.types.ts`**
- You may refactor:
  - `SnackBar.tsx`
  - `SnackBar.variants.ts`
- You may add new files if you feel it improves the design
- Assume this code is used in production


## Deliverable

Clone the repository, refactor the files, and send back the updated code through your own repository link.

Please do not spend more than 90 minutes.
